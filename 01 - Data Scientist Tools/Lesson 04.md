# R Markdown

R Markdown is a way of creating fully reproducible documents, in which both text and code can be combined. 

To use R Markdown, we nee to install it with `install.packages("rmarkdown")`. In RStudio it can be created going to File > New File > R Markdown.

If it is needed, install TinyTex with ``tinytex::install_tinytex()`
