# R Markdown

R Markdown is a way of creating fully reproducible documents, in which both text and code can be combined. 

To use R Markdown, we nee to install it with `install.packages("rmarkdown")`. In RStudio it can be created going to File > New File > R Markdown.

To save the file and export to the desired output (PDF, HTML or Word), use the **Knit** command in the script area. If it is needed, install TinyTex with `tinytex::install_tinytex()` on the console.
