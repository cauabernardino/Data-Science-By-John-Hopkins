# Types of data science questions

There are, broadly speaking, six categories in which data analyses fall. In the approximate order of difficulty, they are:

1.  Descriptive 
2.  Exploratory  
3.  Inferential  
4.  Predictive  
5.  Causal  
6.  Mechanistic

## Descriptive analysis

-  **describe** or **summarize** a set of data.
