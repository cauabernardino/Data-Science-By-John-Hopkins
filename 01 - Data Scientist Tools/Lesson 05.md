# Types of data science questions

There are, broadly speaking, six categories in which data analyses fall. In the approximate order of difficulty, they are:

1.  Descriptive 
2.  Exploratory  
3.  Inferential  
4.  Predictive  
5.  Causal  
6.  Mechanistic

## Descriptive analysis

The goal is to **describe** or **summarize** a set of data.

- Early analysis when receive new data
- Generate simple summaries about the samples and their measurements
	- Eg: measures of central tendency or measures of variability
- NOT for generalizing the results of the analysis to larger population or trying to make conclusions
