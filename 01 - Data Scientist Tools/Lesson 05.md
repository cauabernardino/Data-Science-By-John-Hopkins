# Types of data science questions

There are, broadly speaking, six categories in which data analyses fall. In the approximate order of difficulty, they are:

1.  Descriptive 
2.  Exploratory  
3.  Inferential  
4.  Predictive  
5.  Causal  
6.  Mechanistic

## Descriptive analysis

The goal is to **describe** or **summarize** a set of data.

- Early analysis when receive new data
- Generate simple summaries about the samples and their measurements
	- Eg: measures of central tendency or measures of variability
- NOT for generalizing the results of the analysis to larger population or trying to make conclusions

## Exploratory analysis

The goal is to examine or explore the data and finde relationships that weren't previously known.

- Explore how different variables might be related (but do not confirm that relationship as causative)
- ==Correlation does not imply causation==
- Useful for discovering new connections
- Help to formulate hypotheses and drive the design of future studies and data collections

## Inferential analysis

The goal is to use
