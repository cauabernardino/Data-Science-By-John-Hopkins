# Types of data science questions

There are, broadly speaking, six categories in which data analyses fall. In the approximate order of difficulty, they are:

1.  Descriptive 
2.  Exploratory  
3.  Inferential  
4.  Predictive  
5.  Causal  
6.  Mechanistic

## Descriptive analysis

The goal is to **describe** or **summarize** a set of data.

- Early analysis when receive new data
- Generate simple summaries about the samples and their measurements
	- Eg: measures of central tendency or measures of variability
- NOT for generalizing the results of the analysis to larger population or trying to make conclusions

## Exploratory analysis

The goal is to examine or **explore** the data and find **relationships** that weren't previously known.

- Explore how different variables might be related (but do not confirm that relationship as causative)
- ==Correlation does not imply causation==
- Useful for discovering new connections
- Help to formulate hypotheses and drive the design of future studies and data collections

## Inferential analysis

The goal is to use a relatively **small sample** of data to **infer** or say something about the **population** at large.

- Provide your estimate of the variable for the population and provide your uncertainty about your estimate
- Ability to accurately infer information about the larger population depends heavily on sampling scheme

##  Predictive analysis

The goal is to use **current** and **historical** data to make **predictions** about **future** data.

- Accuracy in predictions is dependent on measuring the right variables
- Many ways to build up prediction models with some being better or worse for specific cases
-  More data and a simple model generally performs well at predicting future outcomes
- ==Just because one variable may predict another, it does not mean that one causes the other==

##  Causal analysis

The goal is to see what happens to one variable when we manipulate another variable

- Gold standard in data analysis
- Often applied to the results of randomized studies that were designed to identify causation
- Usually analysed in aggregate and observed relationships are usually average effects

##  Mechanistic analysis

The goal is to understand the **exact changes** in variables that lead to exact changes in other variables.

- Applied to simples situations or those that are nicely modeled by deterministic equations
- Commonly applied to physical or engineering sciences
- Often, the only noise in the data is measurement error
