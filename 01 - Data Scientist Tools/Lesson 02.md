# Lesson 02 - R Language

R is both a programming language and an environment, focused mainly on statistical analysis and graphics.

R is downloaded from the [Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/).

## Why should you use R?

1. Popularity - which means new functionalities developed with frequency and better support
2. R is **free**
3. Versatility - can make websites, maps using GIS data, etc.
4. R has a very active community

## Installing R

There's a tutorial on the course, but there's plenty on the internet as well. I'll leave this recent Data Camp tutorial that is very complete and easy:
