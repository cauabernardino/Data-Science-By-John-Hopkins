# Experimental Design

From the course definition:
> Experimental design is organizing an experiment so that you have the correct data (and enough of it!) to clearly and effectively answer your data science question. This process involves clearly formulating your question in advance of any data collection, designing the best set-up possible to gather the data to answer your question, identifying problems or sources of error in your design, and only then, collecting the appropriate data.


## Principles of experimental design

**Independent variable (or factor)**: A variable that can be manipulated; it does not depend on other variables being measured. Often displayed on the x-axis.

**Dependent variable:** The variable that is expected to change as a result of changes in the independent variable. Often displayed on the y-axis, so that changes in X, the independent variable, effect changes in Y.
