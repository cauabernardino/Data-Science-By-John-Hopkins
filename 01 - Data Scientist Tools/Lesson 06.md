# Experimental Design

From the course definition:
> Experimental design is organizing an experiment so that you have the correct data (and enough of it!) to clearly and effectively answer your data science question. This process involves clearly formulating your question in advance of any data collection, designing the best set-up possible to gather the data to answer your question, identifying problems or sources of error in your design, and only then, collecting the appropriate data.


## Principles of experimental design

**Independent variable (or factor)**: A variable that can be manipulated; it does not depend on other variables being measured. Often displayed on the x-axis.

**Dependent variable**: The variable that is expected to change as a result of changes in the independent variable. Often displayed on the y-axis.

**Hypothesis**: Essentially a guess of the relationship between the variables and the outcome of your experiment.

**Confounder**: An extraneous variable that may affect the relationship between the dependent and independent variables.

**Control group**: A group of experimental subjects that have controlled characteristics and are _not_ manipulated.

**Randomization**: Used as a tool to balance the effects of confounders when you don't know who they are. It helps lessen the risk of biasing a control group, for example.

**Replication**: Repeating an experiment with different experimental subjects.



Also, the best practices ask for sharing the data or code for anal
