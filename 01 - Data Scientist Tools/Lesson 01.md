# Lesson 01 - What is data science?

Data science means using data to answer questions!

**A data scientist uses data to answer questions!**

A good data scientist asks questions first and seeks out relevant data second.

## What is data?

From Cambridge English Dictionary:

> Information, especially facts or numbers, collected to be examined and considered and used to help decision-making.

From Wikipedia:
> A set of values of qualitative or quantitative variables.

**Variable**: Measurements or characteristics of an item
**Qualitative variable**: Measurements or information about qualities

## Getting help

Some useful tips to solve problems:
- First of all, read the manuals (R and Python help files, for example)
- Searching Google and relevant forums (StackOverflow, etc)
- Check your code for typos!
- Read the error messagens and **understand them**
- Google the error message
- Consider how the output was different from what you expected
- Think about what it looks like the command actually did, why it would do that, and not what you wanted
- Look for more experienced people!
- Explain to your [Rubber Duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)	


 ## The Data Science Process

1. Forming the question
2. Finding or generating the data
3. Analyze the data by exploring
4. Analyze the data by modeling
5. Communicate to others

## Big data 

Big data involves large data sets of diverse data types that are being generated very rapidly.
