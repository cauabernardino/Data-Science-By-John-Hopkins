# Lesson 01 - What is data science?

Data science means using data to answer questions!

**A data scientist uses data to answer questions!**

A good data scientist asks questions first and seeks out relevant data second.

## What is data?

From Cambridge English Dictionary:

> Information, especially facts or numbers, collected to be examined and considered and used to help decision-making.

From Wikipedia:
> A set of values of qualitative or quantitative variables.

**Set**: In statistics, the population you are trying to discover something about
**Variable**: Measurements or characteristics of an item
**Qualitative variable**: Measurements or information about qualities
**Quantitative variable** Measurements or information about quantities or numerical items

## Big data 

Big data involves large data sets of diverse data types that are being generated very rapidly. 

+ Volume
+ Velocity
+ Variety

From the course:
> What is considered “data” has evolved, so that there is now more than ever - companies have recognized the benefits to collecting different sorts of information, and the rise of the internet and technology have allowed different and varied data sets to be more easily collected and available for analysis. One of the main shifts in data science has been moving from structured data sets to tackling unstructured data.

**Structured data**: What traditionally is thought of data; long tables, spreadsheets, or databases.
**Unstructured data**:

## Getting help

Some useful tips to solve problems:
- First of all, read the manuals (R and Python help files, for example)
- Searching Google and relevant forums (StackOverflow, etc)
- Check your code for typos!
- Read the error messagens and **understand them**
- Google the error message
- Consider how the output was different from what you expected
- Think about what it looks like the command actually did, why it would do that, and not what you wanted
- Look for more experienced people!

 ## The Data Science Process

1. Forming the question
2. Finding or generating the data
3. Analyze the data by exploring
4. Analyze the data by modeling
5. Communicate to others
