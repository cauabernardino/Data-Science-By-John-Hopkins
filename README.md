# Data Science by John Hopkins University

My notes and views regarding the Data Science coursework (using R language) by John Hopkins, in Coursera.
Link to the course [here](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science).

## Purpose

As a person who has a very basic knowledge on data science concepts with R, I'll try to sumarize the most importante topics I'll find during the course,  the developed codes, as well as other materials that I find relevant to it.

There is no intention of replacing the course importance, just to be a notebook and a place to look for quick tips and reminders.
