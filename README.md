# Data Science by John Hopkins University

My notes and views regarding the Data Science coursework by John Hopkins, using R language, in Coursera.
Link to the course [here](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science).

## Purpose

As a person who has a very basic knowledge on data science concepts and R, I'll try to sumarize the most importante topics I'll find during the course, as well as other materials that I find relevant to it.
There is no intention of replacing the course importance, just to be a notebook and a place to look for quick tips and reminders.
