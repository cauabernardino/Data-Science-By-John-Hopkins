# R Input and Evaluation

The things that are typed at the R prompt are called **expressions**.

The `<-` symbol is the assingment operator.

```r
> x <- 1
> print(x) # Explicit printing
[1] 1
> x # Auto printing 
[1] 1
> msg <- "hello" 
```
You can explict or auto print an object. The `#` character indicates a comment. Anything in the right is ignored.

The `[1]` indicates that x is a vector and 5 is the first element.
