# Random Numbers (Simulation)

Functions for probability distributions in R:
- `rnorm()`: generate random Normal variates with a given mean and standard deviation
- `dnorm()`: evaluate the Normal probability density (with a given mean/SD) at a point (or vector of
points)
- `pnorm()`: evaluate the cumulative distribution function for a Normal distribution
- `rpois()`: generate random Poisson variates with a given rate
