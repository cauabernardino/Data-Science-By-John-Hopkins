# Overview and History of R

R is a dialect of the S language. S is a language that was developed by John Chambers and others at Bell Labs, iniated in 1976.

R was created in 1991, in New Zealand by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman. Their experience developing R is documented in a 1996 JCGS paper. In 1995 it was used the GNU General Public License to make R free software.

## Features of R

From the lecture notes:
> - Syntax is very similar to S, making it easy for S-PLUS users to switch over. 
>- Semantics are superficially similar to S, but in reality are quite different (more on that later). 
>- Runs on almost any standard computing platform/OS (even on the PlayStation 3) 
>- Frequent releases (annual + bugfix releases); active development.
